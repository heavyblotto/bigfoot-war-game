## UX Considerations

- Implement slot machine-inspired animations and sound effects throughout the game to reinforce the theme
- Use consistent color schemes and button styles across all pages for a cohesive look
- Ensure clear visual feedback for all user actions (button clicks, card plays, etc.)
- Implement smooth transitions between different game states and screens
- Design responsive layouts to accommodate various device sizes and orientations
- Include loading indicators for any actions that may take time (e.g., opponent matching, data fetching)
- Provide clear, concise instructions and tooltips to guide players through the game

This flow and UX design builds upon the existing game design and features, providing a structure for implementing the user interface and experience.
