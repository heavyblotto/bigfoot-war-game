# State Management Plan

## Current State
- Zustand has been partially implemented for state management.
- userStore, authStore, and gameStore have been created and are being used in some components.
- A custom useAuth hook has been implemented to encapsulate common auth operations.
- gameStore.js is correctly integrated and used in the application.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Update Remaining Components

Refactor any remaining components to use Zustand stores instead of local state and prop drilling.

### 2. Review and Update API Calls

Ensure all API calls are correctly updating the Zustand stores:

a. Review the following API handlers:
- Login (/api/auth/login)
- Registration (/api/auth/register)
- Update Email (/api/auth/update-email)
- Update Password (/api/auth/update-password)
- Logout (client-side)

b. Verify that API handlers are updating stores correctly:
1. Login handler:
- Confirm it's updating both userStore and authStore on successful login.
2. Registration handler:
- Ensure it's updating both stores on successful registration.
3. Update email handler:
- Verify it's updating the user store on successful email update.
4. Update password handler:
- Confirm error handling is consistent with other handlers.
5. Logout functionality:
- Ensure it's clearing both userStore and authStore.

Status: done.

### 3. Implement Persistence for User Store

Add persistence to the user store (similar to what's already done for the auth store):
- Update `userStore.js` to include persistence:
  ```javascript
  import { create } from 'zustand';
  import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware';

  export const useUserStore = create(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        // ... existing store logic
      }),
      {
        name: 'user-storage',
        getStorage: () => localStorage,
      }
    )
  );
  ```

Status: done.

### 4. Update Route Guards

Modify route guards to use Zustand stores for checking authentication status. This may involve updating the middleware:
- Update middleware to use `useAuthStore`:
  ```javascript
  import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';

  export function middleware(request) {
    const isAuthenticated = useAuthStore.getState().isAuthenticated;
    // Use isAuthenticated to determine route access
    // ...
  }
  ```
Status: done.

### 5. Testing and Debugging

Perform thorough testing of the state management implementation:
- Test all components that use Zustand stores
- Verify that state updates are reflected correctly across the application
- Test persistence by refreshing the page and checking if state is maintained
- Debug any issues that arise during testing

Status: done.

## Conclusion

This updated plan builds upon the progress already made in implementing Zustand for state management. By completing these remaining tasks, we will achieve a fully integrated state management system across the application, resulting in more predictable state updates, easier management of global state, and improved performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.
