# Database Design and Management

## Overview
This project uses Vercel's PostgreSQL feature for database management. This document outlines the database schema, migration strategies, and best practices for database operations.

## Schema
(To be implemented)
- Users table
- Characters table
- Game sessions table
- Achievements table

## Migrations
- Use a migration tool (e.g., Prisma Migrate) to manage database schema changes
- Keep migration files in version control

## Best Practices
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried columns
- Use transactions for operations that require multiple related changes
- Regularly backup the database

## Connection
- Store the database connection string as an environment variable in Vercel
- Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently

## ORM
- Consider using Prisma as an ORM for type-safe database operations
- Define models in Prisma schema that correspond to database tables

## Security
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted before storing in the database
- Implement row-level security where necessary
- Regularly audit and update database access permissions
