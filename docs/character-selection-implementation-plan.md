# Bigfoot Player Selection Implementation Plan

1. Database schema update:
   - The `BigfootPlayer` model in Prisma now includes an `isSelected` field.

2. Store implementation:
   - `src/store/bigfootPlayerStore.js` has been created using Zustand.
   - It includes actions for fetching bigfoot players and updating selection.
   - The store maintains state for available bigfoot players and the selected bigfoot.

3. API routes update:
   - `src/app/api/bigfoot-players/route.js`:
     - GET method now includes the `isSelected` status.
     - PUT method implemented to handle updating the `isSelected` status.
   - `src/app/api/bigfoot-players/[id]/route.js`:
     - GET method fetches a single bigfoot player with associated bigfoot data.
     - PUT method updates a bigfoot player, handling the `isSelected` status.
     - DELETE method allows for bigfoot player deletion.

4. Component update:
   - `src/components/BigfootSelection.js` has been created to handle bigfoot selection UI.

5. Hook update:
   - `src/hooks/useBigfootPlayer.js` has been created to provide easy access to bigfoot player functionality.

6. Next steps:
   - Integrate the `/character-selection` route into the main game flow
   - Add navigation to the character selection page from the Main Menu
   - Implement a pre-game screen with an option to return to character selection
   - Update the player profile to reflect the selected bigfoot
   - Implement bigfoot unlocking mechanics

This plan focuses on integrating the Bigfoot character selection feature into our existing app structure, ensuring consistency with our UI/UX decisions and project conventions. It leverages Zustand for state management, Chakra UI for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and our custom strings hook system for text management. By adding strings as we develop each component, we ensure that all necessary text is captured and properly aligned with the implementation. This approach provides a solid foundation that we can build upon later when we're ready to implement more advanced features like character unlocking and tutorials.
