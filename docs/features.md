This feature list provides a comprehensive overview of the Bigfoot War project, covering both functional and non-functional aspects. The order of implementation should generally follow the numbering, as later features often depend on earlier ones. However, some features can be developed in parallel, especially those in different categories (e.g., UI/UX features can be worked on alongside core game features).
