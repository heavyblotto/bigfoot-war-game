# Authentication System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of the authentication system for the Bigfoot War project. The system includes user registration, login functionality, and a simple player profile. The design leverages Next.js API routes for backend logic, Zustand for state management, and Chakra UI for UI components.

## Implementation Details

### API Routes
- **register.js**: Handles user registration.
- **login.js**: Handles user login.

### State Management
- **Zustand**: Used to manage user state.

### Player Profile
- A simple profile component to display user information.

### Test User
- A predefined test user for development purposes.

### Forms
- Registration and login forms using Chakra UI components.

### Home Page
- Implements basic authentication flow
- Conditionally renders Register, Login, or Profile components based on user state

## Design Rationale

### Alignment with Project Conventions
- **State Management**: The project uses Zustand for state management, as outlined in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/conventions.md`.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form is used for efficient form state and validation management, as specified in `docs/conventions.md`.
- **UI Components**: Chakra UI is used for building accessible and responsive user interfaces, as mentioned in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/conventions.md`.

### Simplicity and Scalability
- The design is simple, making it easy to understand and extend. Future features like password hashing and email recovery can be added without significant refactoring.
- The use of Next.js API routes ensures that the backend logic is isolated and can be scaled independently.

### Development Efficiency
- The predefined test user allows for quick testing and debugging during development.
- Zustand and React Hook Form are lightweight and efficient, reducing the complexity of state and form management.

## Impact on the Project

### Core System Features
- **User Authentication**: This implementation addresses the "User Authentication" feature in `docs/features.md`, changing its status from "Not Started" to "In Progress" or "Completed".

### Technical Features
- **State Management**: The implementation aligns with the "State Management" feature in `docs/features.md`.
- **Form Handling**: The use of React Hook Form aligns with the "Form Handling" feature in `docs/features.md`.

### Documentation and Conventions
- The implementation follows the project conventions outlined in `docs/conventions.md` and ensures that the new features are documented in `docs/features.md`.

## Conclusion
This implementation sets up a basic yet scalable authentication system for the Bigfoot War project. It adheres to the project's conventions and documentation, ensuring consistency and ease of future development. The use of Next.js API routes, Zustand, and Chakra UI aligns with the project's architecture and technical requirements, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements.

## Future Improvements

### Database Integration
- Implement PostgreSQL database using Vercel's PostgreSQL feature
- Store user credentials and profile information securely
- Implement proper password hashing and salting

### API Routes
- Develop robust API routes for user registration, login, and profile management
- Implement proper error handling and input validation

### State Management
- Transition from local state to global state management using Zustand
- Implement proper authentication flow with token-based authentication
