# Authentication and User Account Plan

## Current State
- Basic registration and login functionality implemented
- User model in database with minimal fields
- JWT used for authentication
- Email and password update routes exist and are integrated into the UI
- Account deletion functionality implemented

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced User Model
- Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` to include game-related fields:
  ```prisma
  model User {
    id            String   @id @default(uuid())
    username      String   @unique
    email         String?  @unique
    password      String
    profile       Json     @default("{}")
    level         Int      @default(1)
    xp            Int      @default(0)
    achievements  Json     @default("[]")
    inventory     Json     @default("[]")
    createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Profile Component
- Modified `src/components/Profile.js` to use real user data
- Implemented API route to fetch user profile data
- Added UI elements for updating email and password

### 3. Implemented Account Deletion
- Created API route for account deletion
- Added account deletion option to the Profile component

## Remaining Planned Improvements

### 4. Enhance Authentication Persistence
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Store refresh token in HTTP-only cookie
- Create middleware to check and refresh tokens on protected routes

### 5. Email Verification
- Implement email verification process for new accounts
- Create API route for sending verification emails

### 6. Password Reset Functionality
- Implement "Forgot Password" feature
- Create API routes for password reset request and confirmation

### 7. User Settings Page
- Create a dedicated settings page for users to manage preferences
- Implement API routes for updating user settings

### 8. Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting on authentication routes
- Add CSRF protection
- Enhance password requirements and validation

## Implementation Timeline

1. Enhance Authentication Persistence (2-3 days)
2. Email Verification (2-3 days)
3. Password Reset Functionality (2-3 days)
4. User Settings Page (2-3 days)
5. Security Enhancements (3-4 days)

Total estimated time: 11-16 days

## Conclusion

The authentication system has been significantly improved with the implementation of account deletion and the enhancement of the Profile component. The remaining tasks will further strengthen the security and user experience of the authentication system.
