# Bigfoot Character System Implementation Plan

## Current State of the Codebase

1. Bigfoot Player Store:
   - Implemented using Zustand
   - Includes actions for fetching bigfoot players, updating selection, and adding experience
   - Reference: src/store/bigfootPlayerStore.js

2. Bigfoot Player Hook:
   - useBigfootPlayer hook implemented
   - Includes functions for fetching, selecting, and updating bigfoot players
   - Reference: src/hooks/useBigfootPlayer.js

3. Database:
   - Vercel PostgreSQL is set up and connected using Prisma ORM
   - User model is defined and functional
   - BigfootPlayer model is implemented with level and experience fields

4. API Routes:
   - CRUD operations for bigfoot players are implemented
   - Experience addition and leveling up functionality is implemented

5. BigfootSelection Component:
   - Displays available bigfoot players with their stats, level, and experience
   - Allows selection of a bigfoot player

## Next Steps

1. Integrate Bigfoot Selection with Game Logic:
   - Update gameStore to use the selected bigfoot in game mechanics
   - Implement logic for bigfoot stats affecting gameplay

2. Enhance Character Progression:
   - Implement logic to update bigfoot stats based on level
   - Create a visual representation of experience progress

3. Implement Unlocking Mechanics:
   - Create a system for unlocking new bigfoot characters based on player progress
   - Update the BigfootSelection component to show locked/unlocked status

4. Develop Character Details View:
   - Create a new component to display detailed information about a selected bigfoot
   - Include options for upgrading or customizing the bigfoot

5. Enhance API Routes:
   - Implement additional routes for bigfoot customization and upgrades

6. Update Database Schema:
   - Add fields for bigfoot customization options and upgrade status

7. Implement Battle Integration:
   - Create logic for using bigfoot abilities in battle
   - Implement experience gain from battles

8. Testing and Refinement:
   - Thoroughly test all new components and functionality
   - Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback

9. Documentation:
   - Update technical documentation to reflect new bigfoot system implementation
   - Create user documentation for bigfoot selection, progression, and customization

This updated plan takes into account the existing implementation and focuses on building upon it to complete the bigfoot character system. It aligns with the current state of the project and provides a clear path forward.

For reference to the existing authentication system, please refer to:

```javascript:src/hooks/useAuth.js
import { useUserStore } from '@/store/userStore';
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';

export const useAuth = () => {
  const { user, setUser, clearUser } = useUserStore();
  const { isAuthenticated, token, setAuth, clearAuth } = useAuthStore();

  const login = async (credentials) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setUser(data.user);
        setAuth(true, data.token);
        return { success: true, user: data.user };
      } else {
        return { success: false, error: data.error };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Login error:', error);
      return { success: false, error: 'An error occurred during login. Please try again.' };
    }
  };

  const logout = () => {
    clearUser();
    clearAuth();
  };

  return { user, isAuthenticated, token, login, logout };
};
```

This hook should be used for all authentication-related operations in the character system.

For Zustand store implementation, follow the pattern in:

```javascript:src/store/authStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand';

export const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  token: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  setAuth: (isAuthenticated, token) => set({ isAuthenticated, token }),
  clearAuth: () => set({ isAuthenticated: false, token: null }),
}));
```

Ensure that all new stores are created in the `src/store` directory and follow this pattern.

For database operations, make sure to use Prisma with Vercel PostgreSQL. The connection string should be stored in the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` environment variable on Vercel.

By following this updated plan, we'll ensure that the Bigfoot Character System is implemented correctly and integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure and conventions.
