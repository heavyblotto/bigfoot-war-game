# Bigfoot Character System Implementation Plan

## Current State of the Codebase

1. Character Store:
   - Implemented using Zustand
   - Includes basic CRUD operations for characters
   - Reference: src/store/characterStore.js

2. Character Hook:
   - useCharacter hook implemented
   - Includes functions for fetching, creating, and updating characters
   - Reference: src/hooks/useCharacter.js

3. Database:
   - Vercel PostgreSQL is set up and connected using Prisma ORM
   - User model is defined and functional
   - Character-related models (Bigfoot, BigfootPlayer, NPCOpponent) are implemented

4. API Routes:
   - Basic CRUD operations for characters are implemented

## Next Steps

1. Implement Character Selection UI:
   - Create a new component for character selection
   - Use the useCharacter hook to fetch and display available characters
   - Implement selection functionality using setSelectedCharacter from characterStore

2. Implement Character Details View:
   - Create a new component to display detailed information about a selected character
   - Use the selectedCharacter from characterStore to populate the view

3. Integrate Character System with Game Logic:
   - Update gameStore to use the selected character in game mechanics
   - Implement logic for character stats affecting gameplay

4. Implement Character Progression:
   - Add functionality to update character stats based on game outcomes
   - Implement leveling system for characters

5. Implement Unlocking Mechanics:
   - Create a system for unlocking new characters based on player progress
   - Update the character selection UI to show locked/unlocked status

6. Enhance API Routes:
   - Implement additional routes for character progression and unlocking

7. Update Database Schema:
   - Add fields for character progression and unlocking status if not already present

8. Testing and Refinement:
   - Thoroughly test all new components and functionality
   - Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback

9. Documentation:
   - Update technical documentation to reflect new character system implementation
   - Create user documentation for character selection and progression

This updated plan takes into account the existing implementation and focuses on building upon it to complete the character system. It aligns with the current state of the project and provides a clear path forward.

For reference to the existing authentication system, please refer to:

```javascript:src/hooks/useAuth.js
import { useUserStore } from '@/store/userStore';
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';

export const useAuth = () => {
  const { user, setUser, clearUser } = useUserStore();
  const { isAuthenticated, token, setAuth, clearAuth } = useAuthStore();

  const login = async (credentials) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setUser(data.user);
        setAuth(true, data.token);
        return { success: true, user: data.user };
      } else {
        return { success: false, error: data.error };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Login error:', error);
      return { success: false, error: 'An error occurred during login. Please try again.' };
    }
  };

  const logout = () => {
    clearUser();
    clearAuth();
  };

  return { user, isAuthenticated, token, login, logout };
};
```

This hook should be used for all authentication-related operations in the character system.

For Zustand store implementation, follow the pattern in:

```javascript:src/store/authStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand';

export const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  token: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  setAuth: (isAuthenticated, token) => set({ isAuthenticated, token }),
  clearAuth: () => set({ isAuthenticated: false, token: null }),
}));
```

Ensure that all new stores are created in the `src/store` directory and follow this pattern.

For database operations, make sure to use Prisma with Vercel PostgreSQL. The connection string should be stored in the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` environment variable on Vercel.

By following this updated plan, we'll ensure that the Bigfoot Character System is implemented correctly and integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure and conventions.
